# AOE2 Taunt mod for Factorio

Adds 'Age of Empires 2' chat taunt capability to Factorio.
When typing a number in chat the corresponding taunt will play.
e.g typing "1" in chat will play the sound "Yes"
If you are a fan of AOE2 you will know.
Works best if you turn off the Factorios in-game chat notification noise.
Setting -> Interface -> uncheck 'Play sound for chat messages'
